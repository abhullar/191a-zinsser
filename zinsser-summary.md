# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Amrit Bhullar

Writing should be composed of concise sentences that get 
straight to the point. Many pieces of writing are cluttered 
with big words and unnecessary descriptions, often to imply 
their importance to the reader.  These words and descriptions 
are sometimes used incorrectly or illogically and can take 
away from the content being presented, which can divert the 
reader’s focus. By thinking clearly, writers are able to create 
content that is free of “fuzz”, or clutter. To create the most 
effective piece of writing, writers should look for clutter to 
eliminate and simplify their work.
